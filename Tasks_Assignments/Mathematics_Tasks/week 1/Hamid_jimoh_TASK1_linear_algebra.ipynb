    "QUESTION 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector is important in machine learning because the problems of the world are problems that has  a relationship with humans and basically multi dimensional objects .In other to make this problems relatable to the computer, some form of simplification has to be done which is where vector operations come in\n",

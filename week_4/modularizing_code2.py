# import math
# import datetime
# print (math.sqrt(9))

# import math as m
# print (m.sqrt(25))

# # 3. Import specific functions or variables
# from math import sqrt, pi
# print(sqrt(36))
# print(pi)

# #4. Import everything from the module 
# from math import *
# print(sqrt(49))
# print (pi)

#Note that this is not recommended so we wouldnt import two modules with functions that has the same name and cause name conflicts
